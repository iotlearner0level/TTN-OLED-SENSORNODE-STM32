# TTN-OLED-SENSORNODE-STM32
A sensor node for the things network using stm32/bluepill

This is my repo for my experments with an STM32 based bluepill board+AiThinker Ra01 lora node.

Right now some initial effor is required to compile...

this sketch is based on otaa example and it also features an ssd1306 based i2c oled. Messages are display on both the serial monitor as well as the tiny oled.

In future i will add more sensors to this device like dust sensor, bmp180 pressure sensor etc.

If you have any comments please record in the issues tab.

thank you.
